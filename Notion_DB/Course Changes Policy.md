### Scope

All financial and administrative policies involving community members across campus, volunteers, and the Board of Trustees are within the scope of this policy. If there is variance between departmental expectations and the common approach described through college policy, the college will look to the campus community, volunteers and the Board of Trustees to support the spirit and the objectives of college policy.

### Policy

Students are permitted to add a course in progress during the first two days of a block with the signature of the professor. They may drop a course through 5 p.m. Tuesday of the second week. The half-block may be dropped by Thursday at 5 p.m. Students should be aware, however, that adding a course after the first two days of the block will be difficult or impossible, so that credit for the block will be lost if the course is dropped after the first two days. Students may add or drop courses to be taken in future blocks at any time prior to the beginning of those courses without the instructorsâ€™ signatures. Exceptions to the procedure must be authorized by a dean and affected professors. Students may not drop a course if involved in an Honor Council investigation.

Dropping a course without authorization automatically results in a grade of No Credit.

One of the primary goals of the Block Plan is to provide a framework within which students may devote all of their formal academic efforts to one course. Thus, it is not possible to register for more than one principal course during a block. However, students may also enroll in a maximum of three adjunct courses and a maximum of .5 unit of extended-format courses per semester. Students may also take a maximum of .5 unit during the January half-block. Unapproved overloads result in a loss of credit.

During the first or sophomore year, students are urged to consult with the department in which they wish to major to determine an appropriate schedule. To allow students ample time to pursue a sound course of study in their major, they must declare the major before registration for their junior year. However, they may change their major at any time.

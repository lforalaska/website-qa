### Scope

All financial and administrative policies involving community members across campus, volunteers, and the Board of Trustees are within the scope of this policy. If there is variance between departmental expectations and the common approach described through college policy, the college will look to the campus community, volunteers and the Board of Trustees to support the spirit and the objectives of college policy.

### Policy

**Expectations for Full-Time Enrollment:**

Colorado College values and expects a high level of student engagement both in and out of the classroom.  **All students are expected to be enrolled as full-time students.**  First-year and sophomore students are required to take four blocks each semester.  Transfer students are required to enroll in four blocks each semester in each of their first two semesters at the college, even if they matriculate with two years of credit or reach the equivalent of 16 blocks of credit in their first or second semester at the college.

Part-time enrollment (less than three blocks per semester) is discouraged and students must obtain written permission from the Student Opportunities and Advising Hub (the Hub).  All students who complete fewer than three blocks in a given semester will be placed in a status of Withdrawal with an Intent to Return.

### Procedures

**Requesting Permission for a Block off:**

**First-years and Sophomores:** First-year and sophomore students cannot register for a block off and must be granted permission from the Student Opportunities and Advising Hub (the Hub) if they want to take a block off.  First-year and sophomore students cannot drop a class without adding a class unless they have a discussion and complete a block off or leave form with a staff member from the Hub. Students should go to this link to schedule an appointment with a Hub staff member: [https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/advising-hub/](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/advising-hub/)

**Juniors and Seniors**: Students with junior or senior standing may request to take one block off per semester at the time of course registration. These students must register using the block-off code (GS 391) after discussing this choice with their academic advisor.  Students enrolled in three blocks per semester are considered to be full-time students and must still pay a full semester of tuition, room and board, and fees.  There is no refund for taking a block off.

**Transfer Students:** Students who have transferred in to Colorado College must earn a minimum of 8 units of credit **at CC** and have achieved **Junior status** (at least 16 units of total credit), before requesting one block off per semester. These students must register using the block-off code (GS 391) after discussing this choice with their academic advisor.  Students enrolled in three blocks per semester are considered to be full-time students and must still pay a full semester of tuition, room and board, and fees.  There is no refund for taking a block off.

**_Part-Time Enrollment or Withdrawal with an Intent to Return (_****for students who do not maintain full-time enrollment):**

Any student who is taking more than one block off in a given semester must obtain permission from the Student Opportunities and Advising Hub (the Hub) to pursue their studies on a part-time basis. During these blocks off, students will be placed in a status of Withdrawal with an Intent to Return_._  During this time, students will not be actively enrolled and will not have the privileges afforded to enrolled students, including, but not limited to, access to facilities, residence halls, or the meal plan unless they have written authorization from the Hub.  The student’s Gold Card will be deactivated.  Part-time students will be billed the per-block charge equivalent to one-third of a semester for each block enrolled.

If Withdrawal with an Intent to Return is granted **for personal reasons** (such as medical, financial, or other personal circumstances), the student must reconfirm their return date by writing the Senior Associate Dean of Students no later than **November 1** for a Spring Semester return or **March 1** for a Fall Semester return, unless otherwise stipulated by the Hub.  Failure to adhere to the stated deadlines may result in a withdrawal from the college.

If Withdrawal with an Intent to Return is **required by the college** (in cases such as academic suspension, financial suspension, disciplinary suspension, involuntary medical leave, etc.), the student will receive a letter from the Hub detailing the requirements for return.  Failure to adhere to the stated deadlines or conditions may result in a withdrawal from the college.  

**Withdrawal from the College:**

Students must contact the Student Opportunities and Advising Hub (the Hub) if they intend to withdraw from the college.  If they choose to enroll as a degree-seeking undergraduate student (a transfer student) at another institution or they do not qualify for or adhere to the standards of a Withdrawal with an Intent to Return, they must withdraw from the college or they may be withdrawn from the college.

Withdrawal forms are available in the Hub.  Until a student has officially withdrawn, completed the necessary paperwork, and received written authorization from the Hub, no refund of the general obligation deposit will be considered.  To receive a refund, a student must give notice of withdrawal by **November 1** for Spring Semester.  For Fall Semester, to receive a refund a student must give preliminary notice of withdrawal by **March 1**; final notice must be given by **June 15**.  

Whenever possible, the Hub requires an exit interview prior to a student’s withdrawal from the college. All withdrawals require a form to be completed by a Hub staff member.

**Reapplying to Colorado College after Withdrawing from the College:**

If a student withdraws from the college to transfer to another institution, they must reapply through the Office of Admission and meet the transfer deadlines of **November 1** for Spring Semester or **March 1** for Fall Semester.

If a student withdraws for other reasons, such as travel or an internship, and has been away for less than two semesters, they may request reinstatement by writing directly to the Advising Hub.  The deadlines to request reinstatement are **November 1** for the Spring Semester and **March 1** for Fall Semester.  Students seeking need-based financial assistance upon their return must meet the stated financial aid deadlines.  If more than two semesters have passed since a student’s withdrawal date, they must reapply through the Office of Admission.

**Blocks Off and Withdrawal With an Intent to Return – Eight-Block Maximum**

If a student accumulates a total of eight blocks without being enrolled in a class, they may be withdrawn from the college. The eight-block maximum includes the accumulation of individual blocks not enrolled in a course (i.e. block off), and time while in the status of “withdrawn with an intent to return”. A student needs to petition the Office of Admissions for reinstatement. If granted, a student must demonstrate immediate and sustained progress toward earning their degree. 

**Utilizing the One-Block Wildcard for Summer Study:**

After one semester of study at Colorado College, all students are given a Wild Card that can be used to cover the CC tuition of the first, one Block, regularly scheduled summer course they take before graduation.  Through the use of the Wildcard, students can earn a block of credit that they need to keep them on track for graduation or to just take a course that interests them.  Students should talk with their faculty and staff advisor about their academic plans and goals. Students do not need to notify student accounts or Summer Session to use the Wild Card, it is applied to the student account automatically for the first summer course they take.

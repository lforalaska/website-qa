Drug-Free Campus and Workplace
==============================

As a condition of receiving federal financial assistance, institutions of higher education must certify that they have adopted and implemented a program to prevent the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol by its students or its employees on its campus or as part of any of its activities. Colorado College complies with this requirement and, equally importantly, believes that it has an obligation to create awareness of the health risks associated with alcohol abuse and illicit drug use.

### Scope

All financial and administrative policies involving community members across campus, volunteers, and the Board of Trustees are within the scope of this policy. If there is variance between departmental expectations and the common approach described through college policy, the college will look to the campus community, volunteers and the Board of Trustees to support the spirit and the objectives of college policy.

### Policy

#### Authorities delegated and retained/administrative responsibility

The president of the college delegates the administration of this policy’s requirements to the vice president for student life/dean of students and to the vice president for people and workplace culture.

#### Standards of conduct

In maintaining a drug-free workplace and campus, Colorado College prohibits the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of illicit drugs or alcohol on its campus or as part of any of its activities.

#### Legal sanctions

Colorado College expects its students and its employees to comply with local, state and federal laws. In addition to internal disciplinary sanctions, anyone who is convicted of unlawful use, possession, distribution, manufacture or dispensing of illicit drugs or alcohol may be subject to applicable criminal sanctions under local, state, and federal law. Penalties range in severity from relatively minor fines to fines of several million dollars. Imprisonment is also a possibility, for terms ranging from six months to a life sentence.

Any employee who is convicted under a criminal drug statute for a violation occurring in the workplace must so notify the college's vice president for people and workplace culture within five days from the date of the conviction.

#### Disciplinary sanctions

_Students_

Abiding by this policy is a condition of continued enrollment at Colorado College. Any students violating this policy will be held accountable through the student conduct procedures and processes outlined in the Pathfinder.

_Employees_

Disciplinary sanctions for the violation of this policy by any employee may include, but are not limited to, reprimand, reassignment, demotion, suspension, or termination of employment. Disciplinary sanction may include the completion of an appropriate rehabilitation program.  Referral to the authorities for prosecution under criminal law may also be invoked, especially in cases of unlawful sale or distribution of drugs or alcoholic beverages. All disciplinary sanctions for violation of this policy shall be subject to other applicable college policies and regulations regarding disciplinary action with respect to employees.

#### Health risks

The consumption of illicit drugs and alcohol can have significant negative effects on health. The health risks associated with the abuse of alcohol and the use of illicit drugs include malnutrition, brain damage, heart disease, pancreatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, emotional illness, coma, and death. In addition, use during pregnancy endangers the fetus. Personal relationships and the ability to work and study are at risk. There is also the possibility of blackout (temporary amnesia) when a person consumes a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time.

Employees should contact Human Resources or the college’s Employee Assistance Program for information on the physiological, psychological, and legal aspects of alcohol and other drug use. 

#### Counseling, treatment, and rehabilitation programs

The college recognizes that chemical dependency of any sort is a major health problem.

Students are encouraged to contact Boettcher Health Center for confidential assessments, referrals, and counseling. Human Resources can provide information to employees regarding resources for counseling on the physiological, psychological, and legal aspects of alcohol and other drug use. Employees may also contact the college’s Employee Assistance Program.

#### Compliance

In compliance with the Drug Free Schools and Campuses regulations, the college will notify students and employees of its alcohol and other drugs program on an annual basis. The college also will perform a biennial review of its program and retain the records of that review in accordance with the Department of Education’s requirements.

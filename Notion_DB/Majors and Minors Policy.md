### Scope

All financial and administrative policies involving community members across campus, volunteers, and the Board of Trustees are within the scope of this policy. If there is variance between departmental expectations and the common approach described through college policy, the college will look to the campus community, volunteers and the Board of Trustees to support the spirit and the objectives of college policy.

### Policy

**Requirements for a Major**

Students must declare a major by the end of their sophomore year.  To declare a major, students must file a Declaration of Major form with the Office of the Registrar.  There are more than 40 possible majors at Colorado College, including a major of the student’s own design, the Independently Designed major. 

**Double Major**

Students at Colorado College may complete a double major.  The two majors may be from traditional departmental majors or an interdisciplinary major and a departmental major as long as the latter is not a discipline making up part of the interdisciplinary major.  Double majors require completion of all requirements for the two fields.  The following rules must be observed:

*   Both departments must approve the option.
*   In no case may more than three courses within the majors overlap.
*   The student must have an advisor in each major.
*   The student must complete all-college requirements.
*   The completed major(s) will be recorded on the student’s official transcript.

Combining an Independently Designed Major (IDM) with a second major is a challenging undertaking that should be approached with care.  Since the IDM is meant to offer a course of study that cannot be fulfilled via an existing major, extensive overlap between the proposed IDM and a second major would violate the intent of the program.   Permission to pursue a second major in addition to the IDM must be sought from the Curriculum Executive Committee, the IDM advisors, and the other major department or program chair.

**Minors**

Colorado College offers two categories of minors: departmental minors and thematic minors. Minors are not required for the degree.  Students may complete a double minor in either category; or in a single category; but no more than two of either category. Students electing to complete two minors may not have any overlapping courses. A single course cannot be used to count for two minors. A student cannot complete a departmental or program minor in substantially the same subject as the student’s major.  For thematic minors, no more than one unit of credit can be counted towards both the minor and the student’s major.
